/**
 * Input connection represents the receiving side of a connection
 * between two partitions of two components.<p>
 *
 * Messages on input connections must be received in order. Output
 * and input connections keep track of message order by tagging and
 * comparing messages with monotonically increasing unique identifiers.
 * If the input connection receives a message out of order, it will
 * immediately notify the output connection of the last known ordered
 * message, indicating that the output connection should resend messages
 * after the last known correct message.<p>
 *
 * The input connection will periodically send messages to the output
 * connection indicating the last correct message received, allowing the
 * output to clear its queue.
